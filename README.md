# NGUNI
Looking into the digitizing of Nguni languages and increasing their digital footprint

## Goals

* The goal of this project is to come up with a 
  - Language model -  probability distribution over sequences of words
  - Large/comprehensive dataset
  - dictionary like document/resource that will spell out the use/meaning of each word/phrase in different contexts - detailing how it is used/mis-used, proper spelling and misspelling, pronunciation and alternative pronunciations how it has evolved overtime, it origin, etc
  -  text-to-speech (TTS) model (*low priority*)
  - All documented in Nguni languages
  - Text Analysis (*low priority*)


## Scope
 - To focus only on South African _Nguni languages_, exclude Mozambican and Zimbabwean languages, (hence the name of the project)
 - isiZulu and isiXhosa as a starting point,
