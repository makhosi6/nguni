# NGUNI

Looking into the digitizing of Nguni languages and increasing their digital footprint

## Goals

- The goal of this project is to come up with a
  - Language model - probability distribution over sequences of words
  - Large/comprehensive dataset
  - dictionary like document/resource that will spell out the use/meaning of each word/phrase in different contexts - detailing how it is used/mis-used, proper spelling and misspelling, pronunciation and alternative pronunciations how it has evolved overtime, its origin, etc
  - text-to-speech (TTS) model (_low priority_)
  - All documented in Nguni languages
  - Text Analysis (_low priority_)

## Scope

- To focus only on South African _Nguni languages_ (hence the name of the project), excluding Mozambican and Zimbabwean languages
- isiZulu and isiXhosa as a starting point

## Vision

Live it a world where I can

- voice type in isiXhosa/isiZulu
- get keyboard autocomplete in isiXhosa/isiZulu
- and finally get over computers squiggly my name

 The bigger picture is to bring my culture and heritage to the modern world, and open doors to wide range of possibilities, such as

- Closing the illiteracy/computer illiteracy gap by allowing everyone and anyone to access modern tools using their native languages

- Making it possible to learn and teach in isiXhosa/isiZulu

- Using isiXhosa/isiZulu to communicate at any level

- Preserve and protect culture and heritage
