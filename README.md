# NGUNI
Looking into the digital rendering of Nguni languages and increasing their digital footprint

## Goals

* The goal of this project is to come up with a 
  - Language model -  probability distribution over sequences of words
  - Large/comprehensive dataset
  - dictionary like document/resource that will spell out the use/meaning of each word/phrase in different contexts - detailing how it is used/mis-used, proper spelling and misspelling, pronunciation and alternative pronunciations how it has evolved overtime, it origin, etc
  -  probability distribution over sequences of words **Low Priority**
  - All documented in Nguni languages


## Scope
 - To focus only on South African Nguni languages, exclude Mozambican and Zimbabwean languages
 - isiZulu and isiXhosa as a starting point
